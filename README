# Android swipable card view


Minimalist Android app template using Gradle.

You can use this as a starting point to create new apps from scratch.

## Structure

* `build.gradle` - root gradle config file
* `settings.gradle` - root gradle settings file
* `app` - our only project in this repo
* `app/build.gradle` - project gradle config file
* `app/src` - main project source directory
* `app/src/main` - main project flavour
* `app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` - manifest file
* `app/src/main/java` - java source directory
* `app/src/main/res` - resources directory

#### Debug

This compiles a debugging apk in `build/outputs/apk/` signed with a debug key,
ready to be installed for testing purposes.

	gradle assembleDebug

You can also install it on your attached device:

	gradle installDebug

#### Release

This compiles an unsigned release (non-debugging) apk in `build/outputs/apk/`.
It's not signed, you must sign it before it can be installed by any users.

	gradle assembleRelease
  
#### Description
